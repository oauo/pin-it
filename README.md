## Let the community vote on pinning messages

Pins can get a bit stale, let users just add 📌 reaction to messages they like and once the threshold is met it is pinned.

Invite the bot with the ability to manage messages (remove reactions if someone tries to pin their own message), and add reactions: `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&permissions=8256&scope=bot`

There is only 1 command `:pushpin: x %n` where `%n` is the number of pin reactions needed to be pinned.
